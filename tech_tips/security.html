        <h2>Security - Email, Internet, Password</h2>
        <h3>General Security</h3>
        <p>
          <b>If you didn't ask for it, are not expecting it, don't open it!</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          The key to security on the internet, with your phone, and email is to
          be skeptical. <br /><br />
          The most common form of "hacking" someone’s information is to get them
          to give you the information. They send an email and pretend (spoof)
          the identity of someone that you trust. They then offer you something
          or ask you for something very simple, but then they use that piece of
          information again to get more access or information.
        </p>
        <p>
          So consider – is your bank going to text your about a banking error?
          Are you going to receive a refund through a link in your email? Did
          you expect an invoice that is asking you to enter your password? Is
          that really the email address that your friend has always used? How
          likely is it that tech support called you before you were aware of a
          problem? Or a pop-up number appears on your computer screen at the
          exact time you need it?
        </p>
        <p>
          The key to each of the types of scams that commonly compromise
          accounts is they play on people not paying attention to the details.
          So always ask you self – Am I expecting this? Did I ask for this?
          <br /><br />The key is that if you are unsure, follow up with the
          source via a different method of communication. If someone sends you
          an email, call and confirm it was them. If someone texts you, email
          them, or call them on a different number.

        <h3>Password</h3>
        <p>
          How many passwords do we have…. dozens and dozens. Each system has a
          different requirement for passwords, so we create new ones. Sometimes
          we use the same password in multiple places. We keep note pads or
          documents with these passwords lists and then when we change passwords
          our documents get out of date.<br /><br />The key to password security
          is that we need to ensure we have a method of remembering our
          passwords, but also ensuring that that option is secure from other
          user’s access.<br /><br />I have three recommendations for those that
          find they are always losing track of their passwords:
          <li>
            Write your essential passwords in once place and ensure that it is
            secure.
          </li>
          <li>
            Have a different password for any banking or financial information.
            <em>Different (significantly) from any of your other passwords.</em>
          </li>
          <li>
            Utilize a password manager.
            <ol type="i">
              <li>
                For iPhone users – There is a password manager in settings.
              </li>
              <li>
                For Android users – There Chrome to remember your passwords.
              </li>
              <li>
                For PC users – You can also use Chrome browser signed into your
                Google account.
              </li>
              <li>For Mac Users – There is the Mac key chain.</li>
              <li>
                There are also a number of types of software that provide the
                same feature.
                <em
                  >The reason a password manager is recommended is because now
                  you can use passwords that are more complex. Passwords that
                  have no common word but are strings of letters, numbers.</em
                >
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </p>
        <img src="images/question.png" alt="question mark" />
        <p>
          The final advise I have regarding passwords is that you should only
          use them or enter them or share them when you fully trust the
          situation. If you plan to go to a website, if you are choosing to sign
          in to your email, or if you are opening your banking intentionally. If
          something pops up asking for your password, and you were not intending
          to use that service, just close it. Don’t use your password if you
          don’t intend to, pop ups or redirects are not your friend.
