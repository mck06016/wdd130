        <h2>Security - Email, Internet, Password</h2>
        <h3>Security - Email, Internet, Password</h3>
      <h4>General Security</h4>
      <p>
        <b>If you didn't ask for it, are not expecting it, don't open it!</b>
      </p>
      <p>The key to security on the internet, with your phone, and email is to be skeptical. The most common form of "hacking" someone’s information is to get them to give you the information. They send an email and pretend (spoof) the identity of someone that you trust. They then offer you something or ask you for something very simple, but then they use that piece of information again to get more access or information. </p>
      <p>So consider – is your bank going to text your about a banking error? Are you going to receive a refund through a link in your email? Did you expect an invoice that is asking you to enter your password? Is that really the email address that your friend has always used? How likely is it that tech support called you before you were aware of a problem? Or a pop-up number appears on your computer screen at the exact time you need it?</p>  
      <p>The key to each of the types of scams that commonly compromise accounts is they play on people not paying attention to the details. So always ask you self – Am I expecting this? Did I ask for this?</p>
      <p>The key is that if you are unsure, follow up with the source via a different method of communication. If someone sends you an email, call and confirm it was them. If someone texts you, email them, or call them on a different number.</p>
      <h4>Password</h4>
      <p>How many passwords do we have…. dozens and dozens. Each system has a different requirement for passwords, so we create new ones. Sometimes we use the same password in multiple places. We keep note pads or documents with these passwords lists and then when we change passwords our documents get out of date.</p>
      <p>The key to password security is that we need to ensure we have a method of remembering our passwords, but also ensuring that that option is secure from other user’s access.</p>
      <p>I have three recommendations for those that find they are always losing track of their passwords: 
        <li>Write your essential passwords in once place and ensure that it is secure. </li>
        <li>Have a different password for any banking or financial information. Different (significantly) from any of your other passwords.</li>
        <li>Utilize a password manager. For iPhone users – There is a password manager in settings. For Android users – There Chrome to remember your passwords. For PC users – You can also use Chrome browser signed into your Google account For Mac Users – There is the Mac key chain. There are also a number of types of software that provide the same feature. The reason a password manager is recommended is because now you can use passwords that are more complex. Passwords that have no common word but are strings of letters, numbers.</li>
      </p>
      <p>The final advise I have regarding passwords is that you should only use them or enter them or share them when you fully trust the situation. If you plan to go to a website, if you are choosing to sign in to your email, or if you are opening your banking intentionally. If something pops up asking for your password, and you were not intending to use that service, just close it. Don’t use your password if you don’t intend to, pop ups or redirects are not your friend.</p>
