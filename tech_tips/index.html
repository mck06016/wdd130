          I have provided technical support, as my day job, for the last 12
          years. The majority of the technical support that is needed by the
          everyday users is basic. <br />
          <br />The biggest obstacle to accomplishing the technical support is
          fear. That fear has two parts, first, the fear of looking foolish or
          second, the fear that they will make an issue worse.

          I cannot count the number of times I have worked with someone who had
          just ‘delt’ with an issue, rather then ask for help. <br />
          <br />They fear that someone is going to make them feel foolish for
          not knowing how to resolve the issue themselves. <br />
          <br />To this I say, that I cannot bake bread. Odd huh. Usually gets
          the person I am helping too. <br />
          <br />The key is that we don’t all have to be good at everything we
          do, so there is no foolishness or shame in not knowing how to solve a
          problem you have not faced before.

          The second reason most people will not try to solve an issue is fear
          that they will make an issue worse. <br />
          <br />It is true that if you try you can fail. <br />
          <br />However, there are things that everyone can do both in
          preparation and when something has gone wrong that won’t make things
          worse. These things will also often fix the problem or can protect as
          you navigate the technical world.
