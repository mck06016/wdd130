      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I propose that for my personal website, I would like to create a Simple Tech Tips Site. It would include a Home Page with basic information on feeling comfortable addressing technical issues. In my day to day job I provide technical support, in my family and community. In all of these support encounters the first obstacle to overcome is the fear or stress that an individual cannot do this because they are not technical, so the issue is beyond them. Making people feel comfortable is essential to tech support.
        There would then be two or three child pages. </p>
        <p>
        <h4>Basic Troubleshooting</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>Power Cycle the device. Phones, Computers, TV’s, Networks – general tips on how to properly power cycle and the benefits of doing this. </li>
        <li>Benefits of Backups</li>
        <li>Determine what changed</li>
        <li>Determine if the issue can be repeated</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Email, Password, and Information Security</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>If you didn’t ask for it, and are not expecting it, don’t open it.</li> 
        <li>Only type your password in a system you trust and have used previously.</li>
        <li>How to identify hack/spoofing emails.</li>
        <li>If in doubt do not proceed.</li>
      </ul>
        <h4>How to search for the correct support (may not develop this as it is more skill based then the other topics.)</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>In providing tech support and in learning tech support the key and best resource that IT professionals have is the ability to “search” for the answer. Experience and comfort in working with technology is helpful; however, most issues that are new to a user have been experienced by other users and there is step-by-step troubleshooting to resolve the issue somewhere on the web. </li>
        <li>How to use key words to search.</li>
        <li>How to identify TRUSTED sources.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>  


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>This audience is specific to those that would consider themselves “non-technical”. It does not have a specific age range or group of people but would be developed and written with very basic level of technical instructions. A key focus in the technical writing would be to not speak down to or make a step sound more or less difficult than it is. In working with varied users of technology I have learned that everyone needs technical assistance and needing technical assistance is not an indication of intelligence; the tone of the writing would focus on ensuring that no one feels like the topic is minimizing their intelligence.</p>  <!-- change this -->
