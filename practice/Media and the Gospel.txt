"What are our responsibilities as Latter-day Saints in regards to sharing the gospel through the Internet?" 

The Internet: A Modern Printing Press

This modern equivalent of the printing press is not reserved only for the elite.

Now some of these tools—like any tool in an unpracticed or undisciplined hand—can be dangerous.

Make sure that the choices you make in the use of new media are choices that expand your mind, increase your opportunities, and feed your soul.

You can see how important the right words are today. Words recorded on the Internet do not disappear.

I ask that you join the conversation by participating on the Internet to share the gospel and to explain in simple and clear terms the message of the Restoration.
