          <strong>
            Is this a good trip for kids? What are the age ranges you allow? </strong
          ><br /><br />
          &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Absolutely this is a good trip for children of all
          ages. We have found however that children over the age of 8 seem to
          enjoy it more overall (And parents especially enjoy it more if their
          children are all over 8). <br />&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A common concern we
          get from parents is that their children will be bored stuck on a boat
          for hours at a time. Surprisingly we deal with very few bored children
          of any age. The areas we are rafting through are some of the most
          beautiful in the world, and you never know what you might see around
          any corner. Not to mention the rapids which keep things very
          interesting. <br />&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Each boat also comes equipped with
          a guide. It has been proven that river guides are unable to go for
          very long at all without telling stories...some of which are even
          true!

            Is whitewater rafting safe? I don't even know how to swim! Can I
            still come? </strong
          ><br /><br />
          &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp As with all adventure sports, there is an inherent and
          assumed element of risk. To help ensure your safety, our guides are
          all certified in Wilderness First aid and all start with at least 3
          years of rafting experience. <br />&nbsp&nbspThe most common injuries
          are sunburns and injuries that occur on land. Everyone on commercial
          rafting trips wears coast guard approved life vest or personal
          flotation device (PFD). Many non swimmers go on rafting trips and have
          a great time. Your guide will give you an in depth and engaging safety
          talk before your trip begins explaining what you should prepare for
          and do in the event that you fall out of the raft.

          <strong>What is included in the trip?</strong><br /><br />
          &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp We will provide all necessary camping equipment. This
          includes a sleeping bag, foam pad, waterproof duffle bag, small
          waterproof day bag, tent and a cot, eating utensils and camping chair.
          <br />
          &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp We provid water and lemonade during the day. Coffee,
          tea and hot chocolate are provided during the morning and evening
          hours. You may bring beer, liquor and soft drinks (in reasonable
          amounts, 2 cans per day). You may purchase these items either the
          night before the trip, or on your way to the put-in. We also provide 3
          meals per day, plus snacks.

        <p class="faq-p-2">
          <strong>What do I need to bring?</strong><br /><br />
          &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The most effective way to plan for temperature and
          weather changes in the Canyon is to be prepared for both hot & dry,
          and cold & wet.
          <br />&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Recommended Items: Rain jacket and rain pants-
          do not bring ponchos. Quick dry shirts and shorts as well as long
          sleeve cotton shirt and pants- helps keep you cooler on hot days.
          Button down or collared shirts provide more sun protection on the
          neck. Light Weight Cotton Pants, Nylon Pants or Sarong. The best thing
          for men to wear are swim trunks as shorts if you are cold natured,
          bring polypropylene long underwear top and bottom. Women wear swim
          suits or quick dry underwear and sport bras as a base layer during the
          day. Over the base layer, wear a pair of quick dry shorts and the
          shirt of your choice (polypropylene if you are cold, cotton if you are
          hot). Two piece swim suits are convenient when changing or going to
          the bathroom. Hat- large brim hat offers protection from the sun and
          you will need a good quality strap to ensure it stays on. Sunglasses
          with strap. Socks- used for hiking and to protect your feet from the
          sun. Sandals or water shoes- if not used to hiking in these, bring a
          pair of shoes you have hiked in before. <br />&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Camper
          wear: Bring something comfortable to wear around camp. Cotton dresses,
          skirts and sarongs are all popular options. <br />&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
          Sleep wear: You might choose to sleep in your camp wear. Otherwise,
          you might like to bring something comfortable to sleep in. water
          bottle small day pack for hikes moisturizing lotion headlamp or
          flashlight moleskin waterproof sunscreen and lip balm
          <br />&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Optional items: gloves fleece jacket towel

          toothbrush, tissue, nail clippers, feminine hygiene products, extra

          <strong> What is so great about whitewater rafting anyway? </strong
          ><br /><br />&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Are you kidding me! What's not great
          about whitewater rafting!...<br />&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Let's describe a
          common day on the river. <br /><br />&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Arise in the soft
          light of the early morning after a night spent sleeping under a
          beautiful starry sky. Have a hearty warm breakfast of fresh blueberry
          pancakes or omelets to order, then pack your things and prepare for
          the day. The day is filled with some combination of swift water,
          rapids, calms, hikes, history, geology, stories, and more good food.
          We try to hit camp around 4 or 5, after setting up your cot you can
          relax with a good book or good company by the river, or explore around
          camp while your guides prepare your dinner...something perhaps like
          steak and potatoes, or grilled salmon...and dutch oven brownies...you
          won't forget the dutch oven brownies. After dinner it's more relaxing,
          and you might even be able to talk your guide into another story or
          two to send you off to bed under more stars than you thought were
          possible.
